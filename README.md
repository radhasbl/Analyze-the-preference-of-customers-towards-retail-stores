##To analyze the preference of customers towards retail stores, I utilized various data analysis and visualization tools. The process involved importing essential libraries such as pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, SQL for data extraction from databases, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. First, I used pandas to clean and preprocess the data to ensure it was suitable for analysis. Then, I employed SQL to extract relevant data from the databases. Finally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer preferences and trends, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
